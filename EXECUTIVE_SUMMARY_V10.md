### 1. Overview

CORE ACCORD (Collaborative Orchestration & Reasoning Engine) is a production-grade, multi-agent AI orchestration system that enables consensus-driven decision-making across heterogeneous large language models. The system is designed to solve two critical challenges in enterprise AI:

*   **Token Cost Explosion:** Our novel compressed context methodology and dynamic, consensus-driven, multi-round protocol reduces token consumption by up to 80-90% compared to traditional approaches.
*   **Evaluation Standards Gap:** We provide a standardized evaluation framework (compliant with HELM, OpenAI Evals) and a rich set of multi-agent metrics to ensure output quality, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

The system is deployed on Cloudflare's global edge network and currently orchestrates five diverse AI models to ensure robust, unbiased analysis.

### 2. Key Technical Innovations (As Implemented)

*   **Dynamic Multi-Round Protocol:** The system now implements a full, dynamic, multi-round collaboration framework. The number of rounds is not fixed but is determined automatically by the level of semantic consensus among the models.
    *   **Strong Consensus (>80%):** The process terminates early, saving time and cost.
    *   **Moderate Consensus (50-80%):** The system proceeds to the next round with a prompt focused on refining positions.
    *   **Low Consensus (<50%):** The system proceeds with a prompt focused on exploring and defending divergent viewpoints.
    *   **Stalemate:** The process terminates after a maximum of 3 rounds if no consensus is reached, escalating the well-documented disagreement for human review.
*   **Compressed Context:** Between rounds, the full text of previous responses is compressed into a token-efficient summary of key insights, maintaining state while minimizing cost.
*   **Self-Policing Mechanism:** Prompts are engineered with a "self-assessment footer" that instructs models to avoid redundancy and low-value contributions, preventing infinite loops and ensuring meaningful collaboration.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** The final API output is a single, comprehensive JSON object containing a full audit trail of each model's response in every round, along with the final consensus analysis and evaluation metrics.

### 3. Current Project Status

*   **Phase 1: Backend Overhaul - COMPLETE**
    *   The Cloudflare Worker has been successfully refactored to implement the full, dynamic, multi-round protocol described above.
    *   The backend is now a single, powerful endpoint that orchestrates the entire collaboration process automatically.
    *   The latest version has been deployed.

*   **Phase 2: Frontend Overhaul - PENDING**
    *   The next step is to build a new user interface that can parse and visualize the rich, multi-round data provided by the new backend.
    *   This will involve creating components to display the audit trail, the round-by-round evolution of consensus, and the final, structured report.

### 4. Next Steps

1.  **Test the New Backend:** Verify that the deployed backend is correctly executing the multi-round protocol.
2.  **Begin Frontend Overhaul:** Start the development of the new React-based user interface as per the agreed-upon design.
