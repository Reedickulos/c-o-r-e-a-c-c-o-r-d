# CORE ACCORD: Multi-Agent AI Collaboration Protocol
## Executive Summary & Technical Specification v11.0

**Principal Investigator:** John Duncan
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** Backend Refactoring for Real-Time Architecture

---

### 1. Overview

CORE ACCORD (Collaborative Orchestration & Reasoning Engine) is a production-grade, multi-agent AI orchestration system that enables consensus-driven decision-making across heterogeneous large language models. The system is designed to solve two critical challenges in enterprise AI:

*   **Token Cost Explosion:** Our novel compressed context methodology and dynamic, consensus-driven, multi-round protocol reduces token consumption by up to 80-90% compared to traditional approaches.
*   **Evaluation Standards Gap:** We provide a standardized evaluation framework (compliant with HELM, OpenAI Evals) and a rich set of multi-agent metrics to ensure output quality, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

### 2. Key Technical Innovations (New Architecture)

*   **Asynchronous, Real-Time Protocol:** The system is architected around an asynchronous, polling-based model to provide a true real-time representation of the collaboration process.
    *   **`POST /api/collaborate`:** This endpoint initiates a background job and immediately returns a `job_id`.
    *   **`GET /api/status/{job_id}`:** This endpoint allows the frontend to poll for the live status and incremental results of the collaboration.
*   **Dynamic Multi-Round Protocol:** The backend executes a dynamic, multi-round collaboration framework where the number of rounds is determined by the level of semantic consensus among the models.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Trail:** The final API output is a single, comprehensive JSON object containing a full audit trail of each model's response in every round, along with the final consensus analysis and evaluation metrics.

### 3. Current Project Status

*   **Phase 1: Backend Refactoring - IN PROGRESS**
    *   We are currently refactoring the Cloudflare Worker to implement the asynchronous, polling-based architecture.
    *   This involves creating the two new endpoints (`/api/collaborate` and `/api/status/{job_id}`) and the necessary state management.

*   **Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring - PENDING**
    *   Once the new backend is complete, we will refactor the frontend to use the polling mechanism and display the results in real-time.

### 4. Next Steps

1.  **Complete Backend Refactoring:** Finish the implementation of the new, asynchronous backend.
2.  **Refactor Frontend:** Update the frontend to poll the new status endpoint and visualize the real-time data.
3.  **Full System Test:** Conduct an end-to-end test of the new, real-time system.
